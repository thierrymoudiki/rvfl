\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric vector or time series of the response variable.}

\item{h}{The number of steps ahead to forecast.}

\item{lags}{The number of lags to use in the model.}

\item{engine}{The engine to use for the model fitting.}

\item{level}{The confidence level for the prediction intervals.}

\item{n_hidden_features}{The number of hidden features to use in the model.}

\item{nodes_sim}{The method to use for simulating nodes.}

\item{activ}{The activation function to use in the model.}

\item{type_pi}{The type of prediction interval to use.}

\item{B}{The number of bootstrap samples to use.}

\item{agg}{The aggregation function to use.}

\item{seed}{The random seed to use.}

\item{coeffs}{The coefficients to use in the model.}
}
\value{
An object of class "forecast" containing the fitted model and forecasts
}
\description{
This function combines model fitting using tsrvfl() and forecasting in one step.
It's a convenience wrapper that fits a model and immediately generates forecasts.
